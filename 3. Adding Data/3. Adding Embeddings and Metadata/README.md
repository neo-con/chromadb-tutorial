# Adding Embeddings and Metadata to Collections in ChromaDB

This tutorial will guide you through adding embeddings and metadata to a collection in ChromaDB.

1. **Creating a Collection**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/630e85d7be622f180784c25b9ae2e275844f9e4d/3.%20Adding%20Data/3.%20Adding%20Embeddings%20and%20Metadata/add_emb_meta.py#L3-L7
    We start by initializing the ChromaDB client and creating a collection named `locations`.

2. **Adding Embeddings and Metadata**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/630e85d7be622f180784c25b9ae2e275844f9e4d/3.%20Adding%20Data/3.%20Adding%20Embeddings%20and%20Metadata/add_emb_meta.py#L9-L17
    We add two **hypothetical embeddings** (representing coordinates) and associated metadata (information about locations in the Matrix universe) to our collection using the `add` method. Each embedding and metadata is associated with a unique id.

    ðŸ’¡ Adding just metadata and no documents can be useful in several scenarios:

    > **External Document Storage**: The actual documents might be stored in an external system due to their size or for security reasons. In this case, the metadata can include a reference or a link to the actual document in the external system.
    >
    > **Privacy Concerns**: In some cases, due to privacy concerns or regulations, the actual documents cannot be stored. However, the metadata, which does not contain sensitive information, can be stored and used for analysis.
    >
    > **Efficiency**: Storing and retrieving metadata can be more efficient than dealing with large documents, especially when the documents are not needed for the analysis or operations being performed.
    >
    > **Pre-processed Data**: In some cases, the documents might have been pre-processed into a more useful form (like embeddings) and the original documents are no longer needed. The metadata can provide additional context for the pre-processed data.

3. **Counting Items in a Collection**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/630e85d7be622f180784c25b9ae2e275844f9e4d/3.%20Adding%20Data/3.%20Adding%20Embeddings%20and%20Metadata/add_emb_meta.py#L19-L21
    We can count the number of items in a collection using the `count` method. Since we have added two embeddings to our collection, the count returns `2`.

4. **Retrieving Items from a Collection**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/630e85d7be622f180784c25b9ae2e275844f9e4d/3.%20Adding%20Data/3.%20Adding%20Embeddings%20and%20Metadata/add_emb_meta.py#L23-L25
    We can retrieve all items from a collection using the `get` method. By default, this will return a dictionary with the ids, metadatas, and documents (in our case, None) of the items in the collection.

Please refer to the `add_emb_meta.py` file for the complete Python code used in this tutorial.
