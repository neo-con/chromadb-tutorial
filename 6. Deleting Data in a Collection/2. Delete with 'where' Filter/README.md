# Deleting Data from a Collection in ChromaDB

This tutorial will guide you through deleting data from a collection in ChromaDB.

1. **Creating a Collection**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/19fe2c99dc1aa9fe0e1aac930fbef84536759dec/6.%20Deleting%20Data%20in%20a%20Collection/2.%20Delete%20with%20'where'%20Filter/delete_items_where.py#L3-L7
    We start by initializing the ChromaDB client and creating a collection named `matrix`.

2. **Adding Raw Documents**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/19fe2c99dc1aa9fe0e1aac930fbef84536759dec/6.%20Deleting%20Data%20in%20a%20Collection/2.%20Delete%20with%20'where'%20Filter/delete_items_where.py#L9-L28
    We add six raw documents to our collection using the `add` method. Each document is associated with a unique ID and has metadata including the category and speaker.

3. **Deleting Items that Match the Where Filter**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/19fe2c99dc1aa9fe0e1aac930fbef84536759dec/6.%20Deleting%20Data%20in%20a%20Collection/2.%20Delete%20with%20'where'%20Filter/delete_items_where.py#L30-L31
    ChromaDB allows you to delete items from a collection that match specific criteria using the `delete` method. In this example, we delete all items from the collection where the speaker is "Agent Smith".

    The `delete` method takes a `where` parameter, which is a dictionary specifying the metadata field and its corresponding value for filtering. All items that match the specified criteria will be deleted from the collection.

    ðŸ’¡ Use cases for deleting data from a collection include:

    >- **Data Cleanup**: You can delete specific items or subsets of data from a collection to keep your data clean and up-to-date.
    >- **Data Privacy**: In cases where certain data needs to be removed for privacy or compliance reasons, the `delete` method allows you to selectively remove sensitive information from the collection.

    Feel free to modify the where filter in the `delete` method to delete items based on different metadata criteria.

    After deletion, you can count the remaining items in the collection using the `count` method to verify the changes.
