# Retrieving Items from a Collection by ID in ChromaDB

This tutorial will guide you through retrieving items from a collection by their IDs in ChromaDB.

1. **Creating a Collection**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/19fe2c99dc1aa9fe0e1aac930fbef84536759dec/4.%20Querying%20a%20Collection/3.%20Retrieving%20Items%20by%20Id/retrieve_by_id.py#L3-L7
    We start by initializing the ChromaDB client and creating a collection named `trinity`.

2. **Adding Raw Documents**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/19fe2c99dc1aa9fe0e1aac930fbef84536759dec/4.%20Querying%20a%20Collection/3.%20Retrieving%20Items%20by%20Id/retrieve_by_id.py#L9-L17
    We add three raw documents to our collection using the `add` method. Each document is associated with a unique ID.

3. **Retrieving Items from a Collection by ID**

    https://github.com/neo-con/chromadb-tutorial/blob/19fe2c99dc1aa9fe0e1aac930fbef84536759dec/4.%20Querying%20a%20Collection/3.%20Retrieving%20Items%20by%20Id/retrieve_by_id.py#L19-L22
    We can retrieve specific items from the collection by their IDs using the `get` method. In this example, we retrieve items with the IDs "quote_1" and "quote_3".

    The `get` method returns a dictionary with the IDs, embeddings, metadatas, and documents of the retrieved items.

    ðŸ’¡ Use cases for retrieving items by ID include:

    >- **Specific Document Retrieval**: If you have the IDs of specific documents you want to retrieve, you can use the `get` method to fetch those documents from the collection.
    >- **Data Validation**: You can use the `get` method to validate the existence and retrieve specific items based on their IDs, ensuring the integrity of your data.
    >- **Selective Analysis**: By retrieving specific items from the collection, you can perform targeted analysis or operations on those particular documents.

    Feel free to modify the IDs in the `get` method to retrieve different items from the collection. Experiment with different IDs to explore how ChromaDB allows you to retrieve specific items based on their unique identifiers.
